  - Create index.css file for your styles.
  - Create the main index.html file. Link your index.js and index.css files there.
  - Create a directory called modules.
- Re-create your Awesome books app following the rules:

  - Use ES6 syntax.
  - Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the modules dir. Import modules in the index.js file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
  - Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
  - Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
  - Use let and const in a correct way.
- Display the current date below the navigation bar.

  - Download the script and save it to your project.
  - Import it as a module.
